In our response the name variable is assumed to be string. However, this could be some kind of malicious script.

The value of name comes from the client which means that an attacker could put a code snippet that could do something malicious.

So we could insert a link into the server endpoint.
The server endpoint will then display it on the page.
This causes a cross-site scripting attack. We can then trick the user into clicking it and executing some malicious code.

In order to resolve this vulnerability we convert the name variable to a string so that it does not execute a script.
By sanitizing our inputs we can destroy the malicious code so that it is not executed.
