- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

There is no try catch block so there is no way to gracefully handle an exception. MongoDB will crash if we try to input a regular
expression for the id value since it only accepts strings due to safeguards. As a result an attacker could input a regular expression
and could cause the server to crash thereby causing a denial of service attack.

The secure version prevents the vulnerability by creating a try catch block around executing the user query. As a result if we obtain
an exception then we will catch it and handle it without the server crashing.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

We can use rate limiting middlewares so that a user can ony send a certain maximum number of requests within a set time.
As a result we can prevent users from overloading the server with too many requests in a short amount of time.
