- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

There is no way of authenticating if the person who sent in the ID is actually the admin user. As a result an attacker
could impersonate the admin by supplying the admin's id number and downgrade the role of an admin.
An attacker could brute force the id of the admin in order to find the correct id to do privilege escalation.
In order to prevent the vulnerability we need to create some kind of authentication.
We can check to see if the userID of the user is set in the sessionID of that user who is sending in the update form.
We also sign the session in the cookie so that we can make sure that nobody changes the session ID in the cookie.
If someone does then we know that the signed key will not match and we reject the request.
We can also make sure that the cookie cannot be accessed programatically.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

We can also implement a security mechanism like 2 factor authentication. We can also ask the user to input a password
with their user ID so that we can authenticate them as the admin user.
