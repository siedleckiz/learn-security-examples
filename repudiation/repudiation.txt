- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

In the insecure version there is no logging. So this means that we are not keeping a record of what changes we are making to
the system, when we are making them, and who is making those changes via their IP address.
In the secure version we create a log entry each time a change is made to the system. We record that log entry which contains
the time, action done, and IP address of the user who made that change.
Also if any error is returned when trying to write to our log entry then we also maintain a record of that error

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

We can also implement an audit trail to help us with repudiation.
We can also use cryptographic techniques to secure the data and communication so we can prevent the manipulation or fabrication of data.
